            <p>The sea is mighty, but a mightier sways
            His restless billows. Thou, whose hands have scooped
            His boundless gulfs and built his shore, thy breath,
            That moved in the beginning o'er his face,
            Moves o'er it evermore. The obedient waves
            To its strong motion roll, and rise and fall.
            Still from that realm of rain thy cloud goes up,
            As at the first, to water the great earth,
            And keep her valleys green. A hundred realms
            Watch its broad shadow warping on the wind,
            And in the dropping shower, with gladness hear
            Thy promise of the harvest. I look forth
            Over the boundless blue, where joyously
            The bright crests of innumerable waves
            Glance to the sun at once, as when the hands
            Of a great multitude are upward flung
            In acclamation. I behold the ships
            Gliding from cape to cape, from isle to isle,
            Or stemming toward far lands, or hastening home
            From the old world. It is thy friendly breeze
            That bears them, with the riches of the land,
            And treasure of dear lives, till, in the port,
            The shouting seaman climbs and furls the sail.</p>
            <p>
            But who shall bide thy tempest, who shall face
            The blast that wakes the fury of the sea?
            Oh God! thy justice makes the world turn pale,
            When on the armed fleet, that royally
            Bears down the surges, carrying war, to smite
            Some city, or invade some thoughtless realm,
            Descends the fierce tornado. The vast hulks
            Are whirled like chaff upon the waves; the sails
            Fly, rent like webs of gossamer; the masts
            Are snapped asunder; downward from the decks,
            Downward are slung, into the fathomless gulf,
            Their cruel engines; and their hosts, arrayed
            In trappings of the battle-field, are whelmed
            By whirlpools, or dashed dead upon the rocks.
            Then stand the nations still with awe, and pause,
            A moment, from the bloody work of war.
            </p>
            <p>
            These restless surges eat away the shores
            Of earth's old continents; the fertile plain
            Welters in shallows, headlands crumble down,
            And the tide drifts the sea-sand in the streets
            Of the drowned city. Thou, meanwhile, afar
            In the green chambers of the middle sea,
            Where broadest spread the waters and the line
            Sinks deepest, while no eye beholds thy work,
            Creator! thou dost teach the coral worm
            To lay his mighty reefs. From age to age,
            He builds beneath the waters, till, at last,
            His bulwarks overtop the brine, and check
            The long wave rolling from the southern pole
            To break upon Japan. Thou bid'st the fires,
            That smoulder under ocean, heave on high
            The new-made mountains, and uplift their peaks,
            A place of refuge for the storm-driven bird.
            The birds and wafting billows plant the rifts
            With herb and tree; sweet fountains gush; sweet airs
            Ripple the living lakes that, fringed with flowers,
            Are gathered in the hollows. Thou dost look
            On thy creation and pronounce it good.
            Its valleys, glorious with their summer green,
            Praise thee in silent beauty, and its woods,
            Swept by the murmuring winds of ocean, join
            The murmuring shores in a perpetual hymn
            </p>
