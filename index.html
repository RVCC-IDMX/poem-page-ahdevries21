            <p>The sea is mighty, but a mightier sways</p>
            <p>His restless billows. Thou, whose hands have scooped</p>
            <p>His boundless gulfs and built his shore, thy breath</p>
            <p>That moved in the beginning o'er his face,</p>
            <p>Moves o'er it evermore. The obedient waves</p>
            <p>To its strong motion roll, and rise and fall.</p>
            <p>Still from that realm of rain thy cloud goes up,</p>
            <p>As at the first, to water the great earth,</p>
            <p>And keep her valleys green. A hundred realms</p>
            <p>Watch its broad shadow warping on the wind,</p>
            <p>And in the dropping shower, with gladness hear</p>
            <p>Thy promise of the harvest. I look forth</p>
            <p>Over the boundless blue, where joyously</p>
            <p>The bright crests of innumerable waves</p>
            <p>Glance to the sun at once, as when the hands</p>
            <p>Of a great multitude are upward flung</p>
            <p>In acclamation. I behold the ships</p>
            <p>Gliding from cape to cape, from isle to isle,</p>
            <p>Or stemming toward far lands, or hastening home</p>
            <p>From the old world. It is thy friendly breeze</p>
            <p>That bears them, with the riches of the land,</p>
            <p>And treasure of dear lives, till, in the port,</p>
            <p>The shouting seaman climbs and furls the sail.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            <p>But who shall bide thy tempest, who shall face</p>
            <p>The blast that wakes the fury of the sea?</p>
            <p>Oh God! thy justice makes the world turn pale,</p>
            <p>When on the armed fleet, that royally</p>
            <p>Bears down the surges, carrying war, to smite</p>
            <p>Some city, or invade some thoughtless realm,</p>
            <p>Descends the fierce tornado. The vast hulks</p>
            <p>Are whirled like chaff upon the waves; the sails</p>
            <p>Fly, rent like webs of gossamer; the masts</p>
            <p>Are snapped asunder; downward from the decks,</p>
            <p>Downward are slung, into the fathomless gulf,</p>
            <p>Their cruel engines; and their hosts, arrayed</p>
            <p>In trappings of the battle-field, are whelmed</p>
            <p>By whirlpools, or dashed dead upon the rocks.</p>
            <p>Then stand the nations still with awe, and pause,</p>
            <p>A moment, from the bloody work of war.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>These restless surges eat away the shores</p>
            <p>Of earth's old continents; the fertile plain</p>
            <p>Welters in shallows, headlands crumble down,</p>
            <p>And the tide drifts the sea-sand in the streets</p>
            <p>Of the drowned city. Thou, meanwhile, afar</p>
            <p>In the green chambers of the middle sea,</p>
            <p>Where broadest spread the waters and the line</p>
            <p>Sinks deepest, while no eye beholds thy work,</p>
            <p>Creator! thou dost teach the coral worm</p>
            <p>To lay his mighty reefs. From age to age,</p>
            <p>He builds beneath the waters, till, at last,</p>
            <p>His bulwarks overtop the brine, and check</p>
            <p>The long wave rolling from the southern pole</p>
            <p>To break upon Japan. Thou bid'st the fires,</p>
            <p>That smoulder under ocean, heave on high</p>
            <p>The new-made mountains, and uplift their peaks,</p>
            <p>A place of refuge for the storm-driven bird.</p>
            <p>The birds and wafting billows plant the rifts</p>
            <p>With herb and tree; sweet fountains gush; sweet airs</p>
            <p>Ripple the living lakes that, fringed with flowers,</p>
            <p>Are gathered in the hollows. Thou dost look</p>
            <p>On thy creation and pronounce it good.</p>
            <p>Its valleys, glorious with their summer green,</p>
            <p>Praise thee in silent beauty, and its woods,</p>
            <p>Swept by the murmuring winds of ocean, join</p>
            <p>The murmuring shores in a perpetual hymn
            </p>
